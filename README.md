 📊 Customer Retention Analysis

 Key Metrics:
- Total unique customers: *96,096*
- Repeat customers (2+ orders): *2,997*
- Repeat purchase rate: *3.12%*

Insights:

The repeat purchase rate is very low (3.12%), which indicates weak customer retention.

- 97% of customers made only one purchase.
- Only a small fraction of customers returned for additional orders.
- The maximum number of orders by a single customer is 17.

Business Interpretation:

This suggests that the e-commerce platform operates mostly on one-time buyers.
Improving customer retention could significantly increase long-term revenue.
